= About =======================================================================

GriffonBot will follow a set of keywords on Twitter, posting any tweets in
which they occur to its IRC channels. If disconnected, it will automatically
reconnect to both its IRC server and the Twitter streaming server.

The project is hosted at http://github.com/simrun/griffonbot

GriffonBot was quickly hacked together by:
 - Simrun Basuita <simrunbasuita@gmail.com>
 - Daniel Richman <main@danielrichman.co.uk>

   - python-irclib (# aptitude install python-irclib)
   - tweetstream (# easy_install tweetstream)
   - imaplib2 (http://www.janeelix.com/piers/python/imaplib2.html)
2) Edit the variables in ./config.py
3) Run ./main.py
